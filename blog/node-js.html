  <h2>What is the node.js</h2>
  <p>
    Simply put <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a> allows us to execute Javascript code outside the web browser.
    Allowing programmers to write cli applications and generate dynamic web pages or create REST APIs. It was firstly introduced in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
    But node.js is primarily used as web server. It allows to handle tens of thousands concurrent connections very effectively.
    It can be achieved thanks to so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop">event loop</a>.
  </p>

    <h3>Creator of Node.js</h3>
    <img src="../../images/Ryan_Dahl.jpeg" alt="Ryan Dahl's photo creator of Node.js" title="Ryan Dahl">
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl">Ryan Dahl</a> is the original creator of the Node.js. He studied mathematics
      but eventually get bored of it and rather wrote programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stated that using event loops is much more effective than traditional thread per connection approach. Which proved to be true.
      For example there is <a href="https://dev.to/emiliosp/nodejs-vs-apache-performance-battle-for-the-conquest-of-my-5c4n">benchmark</a>
      which compares node.js to Apache web server.

    <h3>Node.js ecosystem</h3>
    <p>
      Let's have a look on the technologies the node.js is build upon. It's written in C++ programming language and it uses some well-known
      open-source solutions.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)">V8 engine</a></dt>
      <dd>- JavaScript engine, it will execute our js code </dd>

      <dt><a href="https://libuv.org">libuv</a></dt>
      <dd>- is the asynchronous I/O library based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop">event loops</a></dd>

      <dt><a href="https://www.npmjs.com">npm</a></dt>
      <dd>- is the package manager to share code among developers (you can also use for example <a href="https://yarnpkg.com">yarn</a>)</dd>

      <dt>C++ apis</dt>
      <dd>- file system, http module, networking, zlib, cryptography etc...</dd>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <p>
      Well as the time showed node.js is very good at handling thousands of concurrent connections and has a very little memory footprint.
      This gives node.js a huge advantage over i.e. <a href="https://httpd.apache.org">Apache web server</a>. Which allocates a separate
      process to handle new connection it requires more memory and time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my opinion node.js is the interesting tool to learn. You write JavaScript on your server as well as web browser. No need to compile
      your code for hour(s). As an modern and interesting alternative could be <a href="https://deno.land">deno</a> which kinda node.js on
      steroids and it was also created by Ryan Dahl. Happy coding in node.js.
