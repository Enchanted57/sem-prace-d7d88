    <h2>What is JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript (aka JS) is the general purpose programming language which was designed to use primarily in the browser.
      It has a similar syntax to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C language</a> however
      it is not statically typed and you don't have to manage resource allocation (it is done by the garbage collector).
    </p>
    <p>
      The main disadvantage (for me) in JavaScript as it lacks the type checking system. Simply meaning that you can pass to the function
      whatever you want and there is no mechanism to protect you from that.  Here is the example.
    </p>

    <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

add(41, 1); // 42
add(undefined, 1); // NaN ;)
add(1, [4, 2, 3]); // "14,2,3" (string) ;)
</code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      As you can see above we are shooting ourselves in the foot but the compiler has no clue whether we did it intentionally or mistakenly.
      Thus it will consider it as the valid code.
    </p>

    <h2>What is TypeScript</h2>
    <p>
      Well Typescript (aka TS) is solving the above problem by introducing the type checking system. But it is also a superset of the JS
      meaning that a pure JavaScript is still a valid TypeScript code. Here is how it basically works.
    </p>
    <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}

add(41, 1); // 42
add(undefined, 1); // Error: Argument of type 'undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
add(1, [4, 2, 3]); // Error: Argument of type 'number[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
</code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>How can that help?</h2>
    <p>
      For someone coming from such technologies as <strong>Java</strong> or <strong>C++</strong> it easier to understand typescript.
      However everyone who is serious about web development should know <strong>Javascript</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In bigger teams where you cannot fully know how your teammate meant to use his function. TypeScript helps to describe your
      intentions. And if someone will not use your function the way it was not meant compiler will generate an error. And developer
      will fix it. This benefits for the secure and robust code.
