  <h2>Anti-barking device (in czech Antištěkač)</h2>
  <article class="short-description">
    I would describe this device as the helper to calm down a noisy dog. If a dog barks loudly the device will
    register noisy dog and will make a noise.

    This project was a part of <a href="https://courses.fit.cvut.cz/BI-ARD/">BI-ARD class (authentication required)</a>.
    I chose this topic to implement because it required quite a few external devices to use (aka <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoShields">shields</a>)
    <h3>Shields I used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>breadboard (for easy development)</li>
      <li>buzzer</li>
      <li>microphone</li>
      <li>LED light</li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h3>How it actually works</h3>
    Well as already mentioned this device will make uncomfortable noise for the loudly barking dog and will continue doing it until it's quite.
    However if a dog i barking for too long (configurable constant) it will stop making noise (most likely the dog is barking for good reason).

    <h4>More detailed look at shields</h4>
    <p>Well there a lot of external shields you can use in your next arduino project. But I will have look only on 3 of them (which I used here).</p>
    <article>
      <h5>Buzzer</h5>
      This shield is responsible for making a noise. You can configure the frequency on which you want to launch the sound.
      You can have a look at <a href="https://dratek.cz/arduino/1251-bzucak-5v-2.3-khz.html">buzzer shield</a> on the shop.
    </article>
    <article>
      <h5>Breadboard</h5>
      This is the helper tool to connect your wires during the development with ease.
      You can find a <a href="https://dratek.cz/arduino/1226-eses-nepajive-pole-400-pinu.html">breadboard</a> on the shop.
    </article>
    <article>
      <h5>Microphone</h5>
      Mic will help you to register the sound and it's loudness.
      You can have a look at <a href="https://dratek.cz/arduino/1358-eses-modul-mikrofonu-pro-jednodeskove-pocitace.html">Mic shield</a> on the shop.
    </article>
    <article>
      <h5>LED light</h5>
      It's simply a LED light which you can use for various sates of your device. For example in this case the red light will be activated
      when the dog is barking. You can buy <a href="https://dratek.cz/arduino/1358-eses-modul-mikrofonu-pro-jednodeskove-pocitace.html">the LED light</a> on the shop.

    <h2>Arduino summary</h2>
    Basically Arduino is very good tool to play with. You can create a very interesting projects with it.
    Some examples could be the next:
    <ul>
      <li>Home automation</li>
      <li>Flower self pouring device</li>
      <li>Robot</li>
      <li>many others...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In my opinion the Arduino is the great invention and it also can be used to help children to program in the very interactive and interesting fashion.
      As always you can have a look at the <a href="https://gitlab.fit.cvut.cz/nurmaali/bi-ard-semestral-task">anti-barking device repository</a>.
