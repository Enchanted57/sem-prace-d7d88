  <h2>Project description</h2>
  <p>
    This project was a very challenging for me. As it requires a very good understanding and knowledge of HTTP protocol.
    I had to understand how to chunk the response and not to lose even 1 bit of information. Had to learn about linux processes a little bit.
  </p>

  <p>
    I developed and tested my webserver on Ubuntu 18.04. For other operating system a little refactoring will be required.
    Because I used some linux specific apis such as sockets. A little code refactoring is required to run it on the operationg systems.

  <h2>What I learned</h2>
  <p>
    Well I learned HTTP protocol and theory behind it.
    I also learned about sockets and how to work with them properly.
    I had to brush my knowledge about TCP/IP architecture.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project actually was a part of my semestral work on programming and algorithmics 2 subject.
    And I actually learned a lot and was very satisfied with the result. Have a look on my <a href="https://gitlab.fit.cvut.cz/nurmaali/semestral-project">webserver repository.</a>
