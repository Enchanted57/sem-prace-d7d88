  <h2>Project description</h2>
  <p>
    I created a simple real time web application.
    That was quite a challenging project because I decided to use tools I had no experience with but I was very curious about them.
    It was a lot of fun to see how we can use javascript on both backend and the frontend.
  </p>
  <p>
    I used <strong>node.js</strong> on server side to create a <strong>REST API</strong> and then I also wrote a client app in <strong>React.js</strong>.
    You can have a look at <a href="https://github.com/Enchanted57/TextMe">chat app github repo.</a> And also look at the list of technologies.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://reactjs.org">react.js</a>
    </li>

  <h3>Project summary</h3>
  <p>
    Project consists of two parts. The <a href="https://github.com/Enchanted57/TextMe">server application</a> and
    the <a href="https://github.com/Enchanted57/text-me-client">client application</a>.
    This is probably most common architecture nowadays.
  </p>
  <p>
    Server provides REST API, saves messages in database and manages sockets connections. The authentication is implemented with the help of
    <a href="https://jwt.io">jwt</a>. The client 'listens' to servers notifications and if needed will pull new messages.
