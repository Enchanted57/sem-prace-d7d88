  <h2>Student</h2>
  <p>
    I am FIT CTU student studying computer science. I like to learn new things all the time.
    My interests are focused on high performance backend systems and databases.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like learning on my own also. For example I learned <strong>JavaScript</strong> on my own.
    I try to apply all my knowledge in practice as soon as possible.

  <h2>Part time dev</h2>
  <p>
    I work as the <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> developer, primarily focusing on backend.
    However I have working experience with frontend as well, for example <strong>React.js</strong>.
    I also help companies to develop backend systems in primarily in node.js and have working experience with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, redis.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a strong positive feeling for open-source software. While I am not involved in open-source community heavily yet, but I like
    just reading open source projects. My favorites are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node">node.js</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core">dotnet core</a>
    </li>

  <h2>Foodie</h2>
  <p>
    I also like (perhaps as everyone) a tasty food. Sometimes I cook some of my favorite dishes.
    I can eat a lot, you can probably say
    to yourself that I am a human fridge If you see me in person.
  </p>
  <p>
    However if I want a very good cooked dish I go to the saloon (czech hospoda) or Asian restaurant.
    My favorite are Vietnamese and Czech cousine.
    Listing of favorite food (in order):
  </p>
  <ol class="capitalize">
    <li>svíčková</li>
    <li>pho bo</li>
    <li>guláš</li>
    <li>kulajda</li>
  </ol>
