  <h2>Project description</h2>
  <p>
    This project was a quite interesting because it involved working with computer graphics.
    User can design his/her program architecture with the help of this tool. It implements <span class="upper">uml</span> 2.0 standard.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also required some knowledge of math.
    For example knowledge of how to calculate the distance between point and line.

    <h2>Tools I used</h2>
    <p>
      There is actually only one tool I used. I wrote it in <strong>C# programming language</strong>.
      It provided all I needed, especially the <strong>GDI+</strong> graphics library.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of it is part of <strong>C#</strong> standard library.
      So there was no reason to use some external tools.
      This project first of the more complex projects I created.

    <h2>What have I learned?</h2>
    <p>
      Well that was a fun project to work with computer graphics. I also learned <strong><span class="upper">uml</span> standard</strong> well.
      Unfortunately I cannot provide link to the repository as I have not used version systems back then.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some time I also learned of how important to use version controls systems such as git.
      If you are not familiar with advantages it gives you please read
